This is a helper app for the boardgame Baltimore and Ohio:

This game can take 3-4 hours to play.  With an assistant app like this, you can shave off 60-90 minutes.

This app makes heavy use of jquery and jquery ui.

If you have played B&O, it should be obvious how to use.  If it's not easy to use, then I need to redesign it.
